                    A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a combination of spirits, or one or more
                    spirits
                    mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are various types
                    of
                    cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added. The origins of the word cocktail have
                    been
                    debated. The first known written mention of cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared in The
                    Balance
                    and Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally, cocktail ingredients
                    included spirits, sugar, water and bitters. However, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s,
                    to
                    include the addition of a liqueur. Cocktails continued to evolve and gain popularity throughout
                    the 1900s, and in 1917 the term "cocktail party" was coined. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of
                    cocktail culture through the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel
                    ingredients.</p>

                    The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as "An alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit or spirits
                    mixed with other ingredients, such as fruit juice or cream".A cocktail can contain alcohol, a
                    sugar, and a bitter/citrus. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as
                    soda or fruit juice, it is a highball. Many of the International Bartenders Association Official
                    Cocktails are highballs. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a
                    duo, and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk,
                    cream, and various herbs.

                    Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails are known as "mocktails" or "virgin
                    cocktails"..</p>

                    The origin of the word cocktail is disputed. The first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a
                    horse is found in The Morning Post and Gazetteer in London, England, March 20, 1798:</p> <br>
                <p class="quotes">
                    Mr. Pitt, <br>

                    two petit vers of "L'huile de Venus"<br>
                    Ditto, one of "perfeit amour"<br>
                    Ditto, "cock-tail" (vulgarly called ginger) <br>
                </p> <br>

                <p> The Oxford English Dictionary cites the word as originating in the U.S.[8] The first recorded use of
                    cocktail as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in The Farmer's
                    Cabinet,
                    April 28, 1803:</p>

                <p class="quotes">Drank a glass of cocktail—excellent for the head...Call'd at the Doct's. found
                    Burnham—he looked very
                    wise—drank another glass of cocktail.</p> <br>


                <p> The first definition of a Cocktail by Harry Croswell
                    The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in The Balance and
                    Columbian
                    Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, "What is a
                    cocktail?":</p> <br>

                <p class="quotes"> Cock-tail is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and
                    bitters—it is
                    vulgarly called bittered sling, and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, in as much
                    as
                    it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to
                    be
                    of great use to a democratic candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready
                    to
                    swallow any thing else.</p> <br>

                Etymologist Anatoly Liberman endorses as "highly probable" the theory advanced by Låftman (1946), which
                Liberman summarizes as follows: <br>

                <p class="quotes"> It was customary to dock the tails of horses that were not thoroughbred [...] They
                    were called
                    cocktailed horses, later simply cocktails. By extension, the word cocktail was applied to a vulgar,
                    ill-bred person raised above his station, assuming the position of a gentleman but deficient in
                    gentlemanly breeding. [...] Of importance [in the 1806 citation above] is [...] the mention of water
                    as
                    an ingredient. [...] Låftman concluded that cocktail was an acceptable alcoholic drink, but diluted,
                    not
                    a "purebred", a thing "raised above its station". Hence the highly appropriate slang word used
                    earlier
                    about inferior horses and sham gentlemen.</p> <br>

                In his book Imbibe! (2007), cocktail historian David Wondrich also speculates that cocktail is a
                reference to gingering, a practice for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that
                the animal would "cock its tail up and be frisky."

                Several authors have theorized that cocktail may be a corruption of cock ale.

                    There is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails. Traditionally cocktails were a mixture
                    of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. By the 1860s, however, a cocktail frequently included a
                    liqueur. <br>

                    <br>
                    The first publication of a bartenders' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 – How to
                    Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion, by "Professor" Jerry Thomas. In addition to recipes for
                    punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks were
                    10 recipes for "cocktails". A key ingredient differentiating cocktails from other drinks in this
                    compendium was the use of bitters. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning
                    of "cocktail" include the Old Fashioned whiskey cocktail, the Sazerac cocktail, and the Manhattan
                    cocktail. <br>

                    Flaming cocktails
                    The ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an <code
                        id="#oldfashioned"> Old
                    Fashioned</code>, which originated as a term used by late 19th century bar patrons to distinguish
                    cocktails made the "old-fashioned" way from newer, more complex cocktails. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the 1869 recipe book Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks, by William Terrington, cocktails are
                    described as: <br>
                    <br>
                    Cocktails are compounds very much used by "early birds" to fortify the inner man, and by those who
                    like their consolations hot and strong. <br>
                    <br>
                    The term highball appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a distilled
                    spirit and a mixer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Published in 1902 by Farrow and Jackson, "Recipes of American and Other Iced Drinks" contains
                    recipes for nearly two dozen cocktails, some still recognizable today. <br>
                    <br>

                    The first "cocktail party" ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis,
                    Missouri, in May 1917. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an
                    hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924,
                    the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and
                    it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since. <br>
                    <br>
                    During Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal,
                    cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as speakeasies. The quality of the
                    liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously. There was a shift from
                    whiskey to gin, which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.
                    Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors.
                    Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment
                    might be raided at any moment. With wine and beer less readily available, liquor-based cocktails
                    took their place, even becoming the centerpiece of the new cocktail party. <br>
                    <br>
                    Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s
                    with vodka often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the martini. Traditional cocktails
                    began to make a comeback in the 2000s, and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail
                    culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional cocktails for
                    inspiration but utilizes novel ingredients and often complex flavors.

                <p>A Manhattan is a cocktail made with <code>whiskey</code>, <code>sweet vermouth</code>, and
                    <code>bitters</code>. While <code>rye</code>is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly
                    used whiskies include Canadian <code> bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey</code>. The
                    cocktail is usually stirred then strained into a cocktail glass and garnished traditionally with a
                    maraschino cherry. A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.

                    The whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough. It is
                    closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, which uses dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of
                    the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, and <code>Picon</code> in place of the Manhattan's
                    <code> bitters.</code>

                    The Manhattan is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's 1948 classic The Fine Art of
                    Mixing Drinks.</p>

                <p>The Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named
                    for the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main
                    ingredient. The drink is most traditionally a combination of cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe,
                    Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and
                    Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe. Some claim it is the oldest known American
                    cocktail, with origins in pre–Civil War New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is
                    among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to
                    describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.
